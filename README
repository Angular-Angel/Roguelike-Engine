This project is a Roguelike Engine that I have been working on. 
Note that I have been using Code::Blocks to program it, so there is no makefile.

Right now, I have added most of the terrain system and the very beginnings of
the body system. Next up is a more complicated system for vision, and having walls 
block it.
